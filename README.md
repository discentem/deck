# Deck - Flexible Logging Framework for Go

The Deck package provides a flexible logging framework for Go apps. Deck
supports Windows Event Log, syslog, Go's standard logging, logging to file, and
log replays for testing. Deck is extensible, so new log backends can integrate
seamlessly into existing application code.
